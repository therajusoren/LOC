q5    a. (i) k is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a char. 
      b.(iii) the output will be 6. 
  
 q6    b. structure elements cannot be initialize at the time of declaration. 
  
 q7    The size of a C structure is determined by  
       the total size of its individual members, along with  
       any padding that the compiler may add to ensure proper memory alignment. 
       To calculate the size of a C structure, we add up the sizes of its members 
       and also the padding in them. 
       The size of a C structure can be calculated using the sizeof operator.
